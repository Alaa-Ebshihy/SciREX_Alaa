1. [] Add NER checks to coref (same) and relation (different).
2. [x] Split NER and linking into two components (Independent - p(E)*p(L) and conditional - p(E)*p(L|E))
3. [] Implement sliding window
4. [] Implement paragraph pairs
5. [x] Remove Material that is False / Reduce class weight
6. [x] Implement random batches
7. [] Implement per-entity type coreference model
